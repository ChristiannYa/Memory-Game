Features to implement:

Game Board:
- Create a grid of cards (e.g., 4x4 or 6x6).
- Each card should have a hidden symbol or image.

Game Logic:
- Allow players to flip two cards at a time.
- If the cards match, keep them face up.
- If they don't match, flip them back after a short delay.

Score System:
- Implement a scoring system (e.g., points for matches, penalties for mismatches).
- Store and display the current score and high score using localStorage.

Timer:
- Add a countdown timer for each game round. 
- Store the best time (lowest time to complete the game) using localStorage.

Difficulty Levels:
- Implement different difficulty levels (e.g., Easy: 4x4 grid, Medium: 6x6 grid, Hard: 8x8 grid).
- Adjust the timer based on the difficulty level.

Animation and Visual Feedback:
- Add flip animations for the cards.
- Provide visual feedback for matches and mismatches.

Game Controls:
- Add buttons to start a new game, reset scores, and change difficulty.

Asynchronous Operations:
- Use Promises or async/await for card flipping animations and match checking.

Responsive Design:
- Ensure the game works well on different screen sizes.
